INTRODUCTION 
The AWS 3-tier architecture consists of a Presentation layer hosted in public subnets for routing and 
frontend delivery, an application layer in private subnets running business logic, and a Data layer also in 
private subnets for secure storage and database access — all orchestrated across multiple Availability 
Zones for high availability and fault tolerance.
ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW 
1. Route 53.  
• AWS-managed DNS service that routes domain names to AWS resources. 
• Can route traffic globally based on latency, geolocation, or failover. 
• Often points to CloudFront or ALB. 
2. Internet Gateway (IGW).  
• Connects our VPC to the internet by allowing our public subnets to send and receive internet 
traffic. 
3. VPC Endpoint.  
• Creates a private connection between our VPC and S3 bypassing the public internet. 
4. Elastic Load Balancer.  
• Distributes incoming traffic across EC2 instances in multiple AZ’s thus improving fault 
tolerance. It also scales with demand. 
5. EC2 Auto Scaling Group. 
•  Automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand.  
• Ensure high availability and cost efficiency. 
6. Web Application Firewall.  
• Protects our applications from common attacks such as SQL injection and XSS.  
• It adds an additional security layer to our environment. 
7. NAT Gateway.  
• Enables instances in our private subnet to access the internet for updates or patches or to 
communicate with third party or external services.  
• It is placed in a public subnet, and routes via route tables. 
8. EC2. 
•  This compute service hosts our applications or backend logic.  
• It is deployed in a private subnet for security.  
• We attach it to an auto scaling group for high availability. 
9. RDS.  
• Managed relational database instance (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). 
• Deployed in a private subnet for backend data storage. 
• Used by the app tier for structured data. 
10. RDS Standby.  
• This is a synchronous replica of our primary RDS in another AZ.  
• It is used for automatic failover in case of outages.  
• It increases database availability and disaster recovery. 
11. S3 Bucket.  
• Object storage for static files, backups, logs, and media assets. 
• Accessible privately via VPC endpoint or via CloudFront if public. 
• Highly durable and scalable. 
This architecture demonstrates a resilient, scalable, and secure design by leveraging AWS-native services 
across multiple Availability Zones. It ensures high availability through load balancing and auto scaling, 
enforces strong security at both the network and application layers, and supports private, cost-efficient 
connectivity to backend services like RDS and S3.  
Together, these components embody cloud architecture best practices for performance, fault tolerance, 
and operational excellence.
